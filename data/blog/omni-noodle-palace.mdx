I got the classic noodles which came out perfectly springy with that satisfying chew you only get from hand-pulled dough. The broth was was deep, warming, hearty and slightly salty. It was served with tender beef slices which almost melts, a handful of cilantro and thinly sliced cooked radishes.

The broth doesn't come with any chili oil which I appreciate. Instead you can select how much or how little chili oil you want with from the container on the side . I put single a spoonful of the chili oil which brought out a deep smoky and almost char like flavour which had just enough heat for my liking.

The kitchen was open kitchen style which lets you watch the chefs pull noodles. This is the spot to go when you want no-frills comfort food.
